- 11ty static site with data and visualizations 
- python scripts to get data from csv files, api's, or scraping, update json files that serve site

cronjob Saturday 00:00 EST - update json files - restart server if needed - changes stored in log json file

Will add traffic monitoring and improve aspects as this is developed. The next stage is more data gathering

My original concept for this idea was done in Flask. This solution was my answer to a simpler setup due to the static and simple
nature of the site
